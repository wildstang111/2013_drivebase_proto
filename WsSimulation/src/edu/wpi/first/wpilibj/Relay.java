/**
 * Class for Spike style relay outputs.
 * Relays are intended to be connected to spikes or similar relays. The relay
 * channels controls
 * a pair of pins that are either both off, one on, the other on, or both on.
 * This translates into
 * two spike outputs at 0v, one at 12v and one at 0v, one at 0v and the other at
 * 12v, or two
 * spike outputs at 12V. This allows off, full forward, or full reverse control
 * of motors without
 * variable speed. It also allows the two channels (forward and reverse) to be
 * used independently
 * for something that does not care about voltage polatiry (like a solenoid).
